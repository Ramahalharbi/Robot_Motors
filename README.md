Requirements

- Arduino Uno 

- Breadboard 

- Micro Servo


  Circuit:

Servo motors have three wires: power, ground, and signal. The power wire is typically red, and should be connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino board. The ground wire is typically black or brown and should be connected to a ground pin on the board. The signal pin is typically yellow or orange and should be connected to PWM pin on the board. In these examples, it is pin number 9.


DC Motor:

Requirement:

- Arduino Uno 

- Breadboard

- DC Motor

- NPN Transistor

- 5.10 V Zener Diode

- 270 Ohm Resistor

  Circuit

DC motors normally have just two wires: power and ground, one positive and one negative. If you connect these two leads directly to a battery, the motor will rotate. If you switch the leads, the motor will rotate in the opposite direction. The DC motors are used in applications where continuous rotation is required. Such as Remote controlled cars, fans, and elevators.
